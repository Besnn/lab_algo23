    "# Insertion Sort vs Bucket Sort: A few test cases to show where each one outperforms the other\n",
    "This is a short Jupyter Notebook aimed at showing where these two sorting algorithms can excel with respect to one-another. Insertion Sort has quadratic time complexity, while Bucket Sort is linear while a certain condition is true: the elements in the array it is sorting need to be evenly distributed. They operate on the same data types (integers, floats, decimals etc.), and Bucket Sort can be used in every case Insertion Sort is usable, unlike Radix Sort for example. Bucket Sort has one distinct advantage: it can be parallelized, whereas Insertion Sort cannot.\n",

    "        ...\n",

To generate uneven distributions of elements for the input, I concatenated two lists: one evenly distributed with the full range and another also evenly distributed but with a much more limited range. This effectively gives a list with the full range but with uneven distribution in the limited range of the second list.\n",

    "\n",
    "I specified that it time the algorithms by taking 10 samples (`-r 10`, so 10 repeats) and for each sample or repeated timing loop, it should do 10 loops (`-n 10`). The reason for this choice is because `timeit` generates statistical data for the time samples, but there is a bit of overhead for the initiation of each sampling take. So in order to \"cancel out\" the overhead, we do a few internal loops inside each sampling take. Obviously, higher values for both `r` and `n` give statistically more sound results. "

    "## Interpretation & Final Remarks\n",
    "For small lists (10 to 20 elements) Insertion Sort is faster than Bucket Sort. At another order of magnitude of elements higher (100), Insertion Sort is somewhat slower with respect to Bucket Sort. Under other circumstances, this could have been attributed to the memory allocation overhead (our implementation performs a deep copy of the original list so that successive runs for the same list aren't faster); however, our Bucket Sort implementation uses this same deep copy technique becuase it uses the same Insertion Sort algorithm inside. This means that Bucket Sort is faster in these conditions regardless of the extra overhead, because this overhead is common to both implementations.  We also see that Bucket Sort is around two order of magnitude faster for lists of 10 thousand elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above results were under assumption of evenly distributed lists (generated via `random.randint()`, random enough for these experiments). When ran against lists of 10 thousand elements of a very uneven distribution (0.9 for [0,9] and 0.1 [10,9999]) Insertion Sort was almost as fast as Bucket Sort. This is a known limition of Bucket Sort, as one of its preconditions is that the input should be uniformly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you should have noticed that Bucket Sort was ran with two different parameters for the number of buckets. The first parameter was chosen so that buckets would be of size 20. This is because Insertion Sort is known to perform better for small lists, and also as a side effect gives us a large number of buckets which in reference to our analysis of complexity should result in a linear time complexity. The second parameter was chosen to be approximately the square root of the input size. This would theoretically give a time complexity of `n * sqrt(n)`, which is still better than the quadratic time complexity of Insertion Sort and serves for a nice comparison against the first parameter choice as well. Unsurprisingly, our hypothesis holds true: Bucket Sort is faster when ran with the first parameter for large input sizes."

Elements are inserted into said buckets via `position = math.floor(bucket_count * array[i] / array_length)`. A side effect of this is that the number of elements shouldn't be smaller or equal to the greatest number. Indeed, the user should get an `IndexError` if this precondition on the input is not satisfied. `array` should be a Python list, and `bucket_count` an integer.\n",
